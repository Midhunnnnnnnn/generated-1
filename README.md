# Github-Art

Create Pixel Art in your GitHub Commit History using a simple Python Script.

## Overview

### Why Does this Project Exist
Short answer, because it's a fun idea. In a world where your technological capability as a developer is measured by how green your contribution chart is, adding a custom flair to it just seems like a fun idea.

I saw the contribution chart as a 52 x 7 canvas to show art on, this unlocks unlimited possibilities

### How Does It Work

This project allows you to generate pixel art in your GitHub commit history. By using a customizable matrix, you can create a visual representation directly on your GitHub profile.

## Usage

1. **Fork this Repository**: 

     Fork this repository to your GitHub account. 

2. **Clone the Repository**: 

     Clone the forked repository to your local machine: 
     ```
     bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Github-Art.git
     ```

3. **Create Your Pixel Art**:

 Edit the matrix in the script with #s and .s, where . represent commits and # represents no commits. This matrix will fit the commit history display on GitHub.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Install the required Python package (Pillow):
     ```bash
     pip install pillow
     ```
   - Execute the script to generate commits:
     ```bash
     python generate_commits.py
     ```

3. **Push Your Commits**:
   - Once the script has created the commits, push them to your repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

Your GitHub profile will now display your pixel art in the commit history!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
